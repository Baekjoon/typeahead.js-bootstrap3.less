If you are not using Boostrap's mixins and variables in your site, you can use compiled css file with default colors and sizings of Boostrap instead.**\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n===========================\r\n\r\n#### -if you have less source files of Bootstrap in your project:\r\n\r\nimport this file to your site's less stylesheet after `mixins.less` and `variables.less`\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n    // variables and mixins of Bootstrap\r\n    @import \"variables.less\";\r\n    @import \"mixins.less\";\r\n\r\n    /* other Bootstrap or custom modules */\r\n\r\n    //typeahead\r\n    @import \"typeahead.less\";\r\n\r\n#### -if you have no less source files of Bootstrap in your project:\r\n\r\nlink compiled css file to your site.\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nThis repo is here because this [Issue](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/issues/378), and is based on the solution of [@kuroe](http://jsfiddle.net/kuroe/qrtua/14/)\r\n\r\nAlso thanks for @emrah and @JoshAshby 's contribution","google":"UA-21699184-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
